# Introduction

## Means By Which Trades Are Transacted


### Exchanges

An organised trading exchange is a safe and reliable place to trade. Prices are published, there is a plentiful supply of all products covered by the exchange and counterparty risk is virtually eliminated. There is a set of products traded, each one is well-defined, eliminating legal risk and liquidity is maintained by the guarantee of a market in each of the products.

Market participants buy or sell a product with the exchange taking the other side of the trade. Members of the exchange ensure that the exchange has sufficient funds to cover any transaction and the members themselves are vetted to ensure they behave according to the rules of the exchange. 

### Over-the-counter

Exchange trades are limited to:

- members of the exchange
- certain sets of defined products
- times when the exchange is open.

If trading is required without these restrictions, it has to be done directly between the counterparties. This is known as over-the-counter (OTC) trading. There is increased flexibility because the counterparties can agree to any trade at any time but the absence of an exchange carries greater risks. Nowadays, much OTC trading is covered by regulation to ensure, inter alia, that both counterparties are competent and knowledgeable enough to trade, and understand the risks entailed. 


## Trading in the Financial Services Industry

Market makers in a financial institution are sometimes referred to as “front book” traders and typically their “open” positions are held for a maximum of three months - often very much less. In contrast, the risk takers or speculators are often called “back book” traders or the “prop desk” and they may hold positions to maturity of the transaction (though they can also be very short-term traders). 

### Two types of trading policy

Where a trade is completed very soon after execution with a single exchange of cash or assets (a spot trade), there is no policy required for how to treat it.

However, where the trade remains in existence for a period of time, there are two policies that can be adopted. One is to buy with a view to holding a trade to its maturity; the other is to buy with the expectation of resale before maturity. Most trading participants in the financial services industry engage in buy and resell before maturity, whereas private individuals apply both policies. To a large extent the decision is dependent upon:

- the reason for entering into the trade;
- the view on direction of market conditions which affect the value of the trade;
- the possibility of resale - is there a potential buyer willing to buy it before maturity?

## Quantifying Risk

In order to quantify and manage risk, one must define:

- the event upon which the risk is to be measured;
- the probability of the event occurring;
- the loss entailed if it occurs;
- the means by which some or all of the risk can be mitigated;
- the cost of mitigating risk.

## Asset Classes

It is helpful and usual to group assets into classes. Traders are normally organised into desks, each desk trading the same class of assets. Processes that flow from these trades are also divided by their asset class.

Large parts of the trade lifecycle are generic: trades are executed, booked, confirmed and settled. But the implication of these processes may vary from one class of assets to another.

### Interest Rates

The asset class of interest rates is usually taken to include 

- deposits
- swaps and 
- futures 

in one trading currency. 

#### Deposit

A deposit (or loan) is a simple instrument. One counterparty gives an amount of currency to another counterparty, expecting its return on a future date. At agreed regular intervals, interest will be paid by the receiver to the depositor.

A deposit can be **unsecured** or **secured**. When secured, the receiver has to provide some **collateral** to the depositor and in the event of default, the collateral will be forfeited.

The market for very short-term loans and deposits is known as the **money market**. Here money can be borrowed overnight, for a few days or for a few months.

A very secure form of short-term lending is known as the **repo market** (repo is short for repurchase). Here the borrower sells a highly secure bond such a US Treasury bond at an agreed price for repurchase at an agreed future price. The purpose of such a transaction is in order to borrow money more cheaply by using the bond as collateral.

Deposits ensures participants can acquire cash and proceed with other trading. When short-term lending becomes expensive, as we saw in the credit crunch, raising money for all other trading is negatively impacted. 

#### Future

A future is a longer term deposit. They are standard products traded on exchanges, as opposed to forwards which can be any over-the-counter (OTC) agreement between counterparties.

#### Swap

Technically, a swap is an agreement to exchange one asset for another, however when used without a qualifier it means interest rate swaps (as opposed to equity, foreign exchange (FX) or other asset class swaps). Within the same currency, swaps can be customised to the requirements of the counterparties, but the standard trades are **float-for-fixed** and **float-for-float** between different indices. Swaps have agreed fixing periods throughout their life when money is transferred. 

[<img src="./swap.gif">](# Motivation for a swap trade)

The combination of deposits, futures and swaps traded in one currency constitutes the market data necessary to produce an interest rate curve. This determines how much that currency will be worth in the future based on information available today. Interest rate curves are used extensively in the financial world. Most trades rely on the interest rate curves to discount future cashflows. The higher the future interest rates in a currency, the less money in that currency will be worth.

Interest rate products are traded in their own right by dedicated trading desks and are also traded as hedges for more complicated trades or cashflow scenarios (as in the swap example above). In most currencies they are very liquid products. 

#### Tradeflow

The asset underpinning an interest rate trade is simply the currency. For the purposes of tradeflow, this can be defined very easily - there are a limited number of currencies in the world and each has a very exact meaning and nomenclature. The settlement and delivery mechanism involves having a **nostro account** in the currency. There are no odd units of transfer, no security documentation and no warehousing issues.

**Interest rate products do not have the notion of a buyer and seller**, as the same asset is being transacted either by a loan or a swap. Therefore, it is important that trading processes can distinguish the two sides of the loan and the swap and know exactly who is paying and who is receiving during the lifecycle.

When accounting for interest trades in a currency other than the **reporting currency**, it may be necessary to provide two values - one for the actual amount in the traded currency and one for the reporting currency equivalent.

For instance, a trade might result in USD 600 000 being held in the USD nostro account. The trade report might show:

	USD 600 000
	EUR 426 994

This allows the reader to see the native USD amount which will stay unchanged day on day, but be able to aggregate all the trades into a single reported figure in EUR. 

### Foreign Exchange (FX)

#### Spot

#### Futures and forwards

In essence, they are delayed spot trades

#### Swaps

As for the interest rate asset class, foreign exchange swaps are a common way of trading fixed and floating cashflows,
the only difference being that there is the added ingredient of the exchange across more than one currency.

#### Baskets

Exchange a basket of currencies.


### Equity

Equities are synonymous with shares and stock. There are many different types of shares:

- ordinary - the regular share in the company;
- preference - shares with extra rights sometimes including a guarantee of a fixed dividend and greater chance of reimbursement should the company be wound up;
- cumulative preference - similar to preference, but certain rights can be carried forward into future years should they not be paid in the current year;
- redeemable - the company can buy them back at a future date.

Public shares are bought and sold on trading exchanges. There may also be over-the-counter share trades directly between two counterparties. 

Trading of equities could be on any number of shares, but certain equities are traded in multiples of common sizes, known as **board lots** or **round lots**. Sizes different to board lots are known as **odd lots** and might incur higher trading costs. 

Either a custodian would be employed or the operations department would be responsible for registering the shares with the company issuing them in order to qualify for dividends. 

#### Synthetic equities (index)

Examples of equity indices are the DAX, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the French CAC 40. The purchaser does not own any real shares in any company.

Index equities should be distinguished from real equities in the trade processes because they bear no dividends and documents, such as share certificates. 

Futures and options also exist on indices as they do for real equities.

### Bonds and Credit

We combine bonds and credit because all bonds except risk-free sovereigns carry credit risk. Bonds are related to (short-term) interest rates and anything with a maturity under one year is usually regarded as being in the interest rate class. In addition, credit risky bonds and “risk-free” sovereign debt are often regarded as different asset classes. 

#### Bonds

Other than issuing stocks, a company can borrow money through a simple bank loan and would be dealt through a retail bank. However, for large capital amounts it is highly unlikely that a single bank would have the funds and the desire to lend by itself. To overcome this problem, companies issue bonds. Purchasers of bonds pay capital to the company, which is repaid to them at the end of the period (term) of the bond. The lenders are rewarded by receiving interest in the form of coupons, in most cases throughout the term of the bond.

**Fixed income** is another name for the asset class comprising of bonds. The term fixed income is used because, once a bond is issued, the expected income is known. This contrasts with equities, 

- where dividend payments are unknown
- Another difference is that bonds have a termination date
- A further distinction is that many bonds are issued by governments, whereas all equities are corporate. 

##### sovereign debt

Government bonds are known as sovereigns. Rating agencies do not apply credit ratings to sovereigns except where bonds are issued in a currency other than one controlled by the government because in theory, debt issued in the currency of the government itself are risk-free to that currency.

##### Fixed

The bond pays the same coupon at regular intervals with the last coupon usually coinciding with the redemption payment. The coupon is quoted as an annual percentage of notional.

Payments are usually quarterly, semi-annually or annually. All coupon amounts can be exactly determined. 

##### Floating Rate Note (FRN)

When the coupon is paid at variable rates, the bond is known as a floating rate note or **floater**. The exact payment is determined only just before the coupon date and is derived from a benchmark index, such as LIBOR. The process of determining the coupon is known as a **fixing**. The coupon is often an amount over the benchmark (e.g. LIBOR plus 50 basis points). This is known as the **margin**. 

##### Zero coupon bonds

These bonds pay no coupons. The bonds are offered at the issue date for a discounted price (e.g. 63 %) and are redeemed at maturity for par (100 %). The gain to the purchaser arises from this price differential and is an alternative to the coupon payment of standard bonds. This means the issuer does not have to worry about having to find intermediate income to service the coupon payments. 

##### Amortising bonds

Sometimes the capital borrowed is repaid to investors in instalments, rather than all at the end. Then the notional of the coupon is reduced over time. Although the fixed coupon rate remains at say 8 %, the notional might have reduced from 200 000 000 to 100 000 000, resulting in a lower coupon pay out. 

##### Asset-backed securities

Some bonds are secured using debts owed to the issuer itself. These commonly arise from mortgages (mortgage backed securities or MBS) or credit card repayments. They are amortising bonds, but the amortisation is unknown at time of issue. If the underlying debtors, such as homeowners, repay their mortgages early, then the debt outstanding on the bonds is reduced accordingly.

For simplicity in this example, the payments assume a very crude calculation of dividing the annual rate in half to get the semi-annual payment. In reality, the calculation is more complex taking into account the number of days between coupon payments. 

##### Other features

Some bonds combine fixed and floating cashflows; others have clauses specifying when payments are made that depend on market prices. Floating rates can be capped at a minimum level (known as a floor) or restricted to a maximum (known as a cap). Convertible bonds can be converted into equity. Bonds can be denominated in one currency, but pay coupons in another currency, according to predetermined or market exchange rates. 




#### About Credit Risk Bearing Instrucments

Credit as an asset class really refers to credit risk. It is a synthetic product existing as a structured or derivative trade. Its primary manifestation as a traded product is as an insurance policy against a particular name defaulting. So it is fundamentally an insurance policy.

As the market for credit risk has developed, some products have become more standard. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) provides industry standard documentation for a variety of products including credit default swaps. 


In order to get a feel for credit risk we can look at an example of a credit default swap (CDS).

- France Telecom Senior Subordination has a five-year CDS maturing 20 March 2012.
- Bank A purchases the CDS from Bank B and pays 62 basis points premium per year at quarterly intervals on a notional of EUR 12 million.
- This means that A will pay EUR 62/10 000 × 12 000 000 per year which is EUR 18 600 per quarter to B, unless and until France Telecom defaults. This is known as the payment or premium leg.
- Should France Telecom default, B will have to pay EUR 12 million to A, less any recovery. Recovery is the amount a name will pay to its creditors upon default. This varies according to the seniority of debt. This is known as the recovery leg.


The problem with monitoring credit swaps for valuation and risk purposes is that many are illiquid at some or all tenor points. This leads to some of the data engineering techniques on data.

Another measure of credit worthiness is the credit rating issued by rating agencies. There are three main rating agencies, 

1. Moodys
2. S&P
3. Fitch

Some of the problems of using credit ratings are:

- Credit rating is only a band, not an exact figure. For example, AAA may cover names with CDS premiums between five and 50 basis points.
- The agencies might disagree as to the rating of any name or they may not supply a rating.
- Agency rating classifications have been called into question since the recent credit crunch and ensuing recession as, in many cases, they did not predict the imminent default of a name.

Many institutions trading credit risk will use a combination of CDS premiums and rating agency classifications to gauge the credit worthiness of a name. 

A very important feature of the credit risk market is that recovery rate is a key input in the valuation of credit risk products. This piece of market data cannot be measured or known until default actually occurs (and sometimes quite a while after). For calculation and trading purposes this number is estimated or implied. The imprecision caused by this input makes the quantitative approach to credit risk very different from the precise world of interest rates and foreign exchange. Risk managers, used to dealing with these other asset classes, must alter their approach when working with credit risk and its underlying recovery assumptions.

Since there are thousands of bonds currently being traded, identification becomes a major issue. Common identifiers like ISIN, CUSIP and SEDOL have been adopted.

Bonds are susceptible to credit risk. For monitoring this risk, the issuer of the bond must be known in addition to its legal parent. A legal database may therefore be required.

Ultimately bonds and equities are linked because they derive from the same underlying company. It may therefore be necessary to provide combined fixed income and equity information in the form of reports to users who have an interest in this connection. 





### COMMODITIES



Commodities are the oldest asset class. Many conventions and idiosyncrasies have developed, which can make processing them difficult.

Loosely, we can categorise them into 

- agricultural
- animal products
- energy
- precious metals
- industrial metals

The two biggest traded energy products are:

- West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil, traded in units of 1000 barrels on New York Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
- Brent Crude also in 1000 barrels units on ICE.

Other energy products include heating oil, propane and natural gas.

There are four main precious metals all in units of troy ounce. Gold and silver are traded on CBOT; platinum and palladium on NYMEX.

Industrial metals are traded in metric tonnes on the London Metals Exchange (LME). They include aluminium, aluminium alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc.

Above we have listed exchange-traded commodities but in fact the over-the-counter (OTC) market in commodities is bigger.

Most commodities are grown, smelted or produced in particular localities. They are subject to local forces, such as natural events and changes in political circumstances. Traders and salesmen are dependent upon good knowledge of all the factors affecting supply and production. Commodities demand very specific research.

If there is a sudden demand for a commodity it may take considerable time for the supply to catch up. Many commodities are stockpiled to meet short-term requirements, but they will not be able to cater for more sustained demand.

Although commodities are traded as financial products with the expectation of profit, they hold residual utilitarian value. This means they cannot default and be worthless, unlike, for example, a corporate bond. 

This dual nature of gold and silver makes it possible for trade processes to consider them as an extra currency alongside euros and dollars, or as commodities alongside tin and aluminium. A decision has to be made as to which will be a better fit, depending on the organisation trading them.

Since commodities are traded between producers and consumers who require physical delivery, any financial entity involved in trading must either be able to cope with physical delivery or convert it into cash before delivery is made. Many contracts offer a choice of physical or cash settlement. Middle and back office procedures must be aware of the type of settlement. 

Trading in and settlement of commodities can be complex. Settlement can be defined by using an average of prices rather than the price on the date of settlement. Commodities are traded in lots of specific amounts and units. Great care must be taken when designing processes and systems for commodity trades. 


### Trading Across Asset Classes

Sometimes traders want to take advantage of price discrepancies between closely related asset classes. There may be a hedge strategy, whereby there is perceived limited market risk, the multiple trades involved cancelling out exposure to the underlying asset or assets - this is known as **basis trading**.

Examples of basis trading:

- spot and futures on the same underlying instrument;
- credit default swaps and bonds on the same underlying bond.

There may also be no arbitrage, but the trading strategy is such that one is only interested in the relative positions of two different instruments or asset classes. Examples:

- In the next six months aluminium will be more in demand than copper and its price will be relatively higher.
- Eastern economies will fare better than European economies and hence their currencies will be stronger.
- Long-term interest rates will rise and commodity prices will fall.

For trading across asset classes, it is important that the trader can book and view all parts of his portfolio for price and risk. This can be particularly challenging when different systems are used for different asset classes.



## Derivatives, Structures and Hybrids

### What is a derivative

Any trade that derives from an underlying asset, but does not involve the direct purchase or sale of that asset, is known as a derivative. Common classes of derivatives are forwards and futures, swaps and options. Derivatives are often divided into linear and nonlinear. 

The simpler set of derivatives are linear products. This means that the payoff is related linearly to the spot price of the underlying asset. Forwards and swaps are linear products.

When the payoff versus spot price is nonlinear for some or all spot prices then we say the trade is a nonlinear derivative. The most common nonlinear product is an option. 

### Leverage

The potential to gain or lose more than the original amount invested is known as a type of leverage. 

Leveraged trades not covered by hedges for whatever reason are called naked.

Risk managers and control departments have various ways of dealing with leveraged risk:

* insist that the trading desk posts a reserve into an account to be held for losses on leveraged trades
* allow only limited degree of leverage
* enforce a hedging strategy

Some examples of leveraged positions:

#### Selling short

This means entering a trade with a commitment to selling an underlying in the future that the trader does not hold at time of execution. The trader expects the market price to fall so that he can purchase it cheaper than the agreed sell price. This is a linear trade as the profit is linearly related to the spot price. But it is leveraged because, if the price starts rising, the trader will have to commit an unknown size of funds to buying the underlying in order to fulfil his trading obligations. 

#### Credit default swaps

As credit default swaps are an insurance product, they are leveraged trades. This can be illustrated as follows.

Suppose a five year credit default swap trades at 200 basis points per annum. If spreads stay fairly constant, the buyer of protection will have paid about 1000 basis points over the life of the trade (equivalent to 10 % of the notional). On the other hand, the seller of protection will pay 100 % of the notional (less recovery) in the event of default. 


### Option Terminology

* European: these options can only be exercised on the maturity date.
* American: these options can be exercised at any time up to and including the maturity date.
* Bermudan: somewhere between a European and American. There is more than one exercise opportunity, but not a continuous set as for American options. It could be that the exercise is allowed periodically (e.g. one day every three months) or there is a period of no exercise (e.g. first five years) and then exercise is allowed every day thereafter (e.g. for the final six months).
* At-the-money: this describes the current position of the option. At-the-money means that the strike is the same as the current spot price.
* Out-of-the-money: means the current spot price is below the strike price for call options or above for put options and so would not be exercised if exercise were today.
* In-the-money: means the current spot price is above the strike price for call options or below for put options and so the option could be exercised if exercise were today.
* Swaption: a swaption is an option with the underlying being a swap. Swaptions generally refer to options on interest rate swaps. A payer swap gives the purchaser the right to enter into a swap paying fixed and receiving floating. A receiver swap gives the purchaser the right to enter into a swap paying floating and receiving fixed. 

#### Options Valuation

There are certain attributes which characterise an option and enable it to be valued.

1. Spot price: the current market price of the underlying (market data, changes every day).
2. Strike price: the price at which the option was struck (trade data, fixed).
3. Interest rate: for one-currency trades, this is derived from the interest rate (or discount) curve for that currency. For foreign exchange and other options involving multiple currencies, there will be several interest rate curves (market data, changes every day).
4. Time to maturity: the amount of time left until the option matures (based on trade data, changes every day).
5. Call or put: whether the option is a call or a put (trade data, fixed).
6. Volatility: this is a well-defined measure of price variation over a given time period.

These six pieces of information are inputs to the valuation model for options, which is normally based on the classical Black-Scholes options pricing formula. 

#### Exotic Options

The basic option is known as a “plain vanilla” or “vanilla”. Any trade based around a vanilla option but modified in some way is known as an exotic option. Here we shall give a sample.

* Resettable strike: there may be a clause in the option contract that allows for the strike to be changed during the life of the option. Suppose a USDJPY option is struck at 124. After every three months, the contract allows the strike to be adjusted to be the maximum of 124 and 10 % over the spot price on the resettable fixing date.
* Barrier options: there are three standard barrier options: an upper barrier, a lower barrier and a double barrier. Each one can be knock in or knock out.
* Knock in. This means that the option cannot be exercised unless the barrier has been hit at some point in the lifetime of the option.
* Knock out. This means the option can never be exercised if the barrier is reached.
* Average trades: in vanilla options, the payout is determined by the spot price on the maturity date (for European style) or on the date of exercise (for American style). In average option trades, the average spot price over several time periods is used to determine the payout.
* Basket options: baskets of currencies or other underlyings can be traded. An option on the basket would set a strike at the total equivalent worth of all the currencies in the basket. The valuation of baskets requires several interest rates and cross volatilities between each of the currency pairs in the basket.
* Ratchet options (Cliquet): this is a series of forward start options, each one beginning when the previous one terminates. The strike is set at the beginning of each period, such that the option is at-the-money.
* Digital or binary option: instead of the payoff being the difference between the strike and spot upon exercise, a digital option has a predetermined payoff amount. It is similar to a bet: if the spot finishes above the strike (for a call option), the purchaser receives a set amount, if not he gets nothing.

Exotic derivatives generally require more ongoing attention. The spot price must be carefully tracked at all times during the life of the option. Although middle office is used to marking spot prices once a day for valuation, this is more complex, because the spot price may be required continuously to see, for example, if a barrier has been breached.

A strict legal interpretation must be given as to what constitutes the current spot price, otherwise the counterparties might be in conflict over whether and when a trade is knocked out or exercised.



### Structures and Hybrids

A structure is a set of different trades bound together to produce a required set of exposures. The structure may encompass many types of derivative and spot trades. 
A hybrid is similar to a structure, but straddling different asset classes.

For instance, an Australian processing company wants advice from the structuring desk of an investment bank.

* They produce bronze from copper and tin.
* They sometimes require aluminium and silicon.
* They buy raw materials in USD and sell to all parts of the world particularly in Europe and Japan.
* They have a floating rate loan on their plant payable in AUD.
* It takes six months from acquisition of raw materials to sale of product.

Staff on the structuring desk will ascertain which risks the processing company wants to reduce or eliminate and which risks it is happy to live with. They will then put together a combination of derivative and simple products, to try to handle the risks according to the client specification. When they think they have come up with a solution, they will test it using indicative and historical market data. They will then write a report or prospectus for the client, illustrating in nontechnical language the proposal and explaining all the costs and assumptions involved. The client will pay a fee for the consultancy and if he likes the proposal, he may engage the bank to trade on his behalf.

In addition to investigating client requests, structured trades may arise from gaps or mismatches in the market. For example, if credit spreads are high reflecting poor credit worthiness, but bond prices are high reflecting the opposite, a structure might be put together to take advantage of the difference, with little or no inherent risk.

The lowest common denominators of any structured or hybrid trade are the **cashflows**. The structurer is, in essence, trying to massage the cashflows to produce the maximum likely returns, while containing the risk to acceptable areas and sizes. This is by no means an easy task: cashflows may be occurring on different dates, the amounts may be unknown and there are the complications arising from the optional component of many derivatives.

Structures are, by their very nature, individual trades or groups of trades. They are therefore hard to process in a systematic way. This often means they are treated as exceptions outside the normal trade processes. Every time an exception is allowed, all the trade lifecycle processes have to cope with the exception. This means the exception cannot be so easily aggregated with trades in the normal process and all business functions have to know how to manage and control the exception. This can be expensive in terms of time devoted to the exception and in terms of the extra operational risk incurred.

Where the structure consists of a group of smaller, simpler trades, it is important that the constituent trades are marked with their links to the overall structure. That way the risk assessment can be done on the structure as a whole.

Structured trading can be a very profitable part of the business. With the control and support functions understanding and managing the trade processes, structurers can look beyond one asset class or one type of trading. They can evolve safe and profitable strategies for taking advantage of market conditions and enriching the services the financial entity can provide to its customers. Additionally, they can be a research arm, testing and pioneering new products and business areas.

Structured trades generally take longer to come to fruition and require a greater degree of scrutiny from business functions, such as the legal department. 

### Importance of Simpler Products

Whenever a trading desk is involved in derivatives it needs to make use of simpler products to manage its risk. 

* Thus a future may require a spot trade; 
* an option may require a future and a spot trade; 
* all trades may require deposits and foreign exchange futures and spots. 

A network is established where the more complicated trades require the simpler trades.

One of the most important desks is the **treasury desk**, which holds the money that traders can borrow in order to finance their trading. The treasury will pool all the requirements of the traders and attempt to borrow money at the lowest rate available. It will then lend out from the pool it has acquired to the other trading desks, charging them for this service. Internal charging is usually seen as good business practice, as it leads to efficiency and costs are shown where they are incurred. For instance, without charging for finance, the efficiency of the treasury desk in achieving cheap funding may be obscured by inefficiencies in the swap desk, and nobody would know where the fault lay.

To promote interaction between trading desks, the seating arrangement once played an important part: spot traders and treasury needed to be accessible to everybody. More derivative products were closer to quants, and structurers close to traders of all products with which they were involved. With modern electronic communications, the physical seating has become less important, but face-to-face communication is still optimal, especially for important decisions or for complicated discussions.

The evolution of trade processes and systems is such that the simpler products had a mature and active market before derivatives arrived on the scene. The legacy systems were designed to work with the products available when they were being developed and so, when derivatives processing was required, either new systems had to be built from scratch or the existing ones modified.

Although most organisations arrange trading desks according to asset class, the support and control functions are very often grouped by product type. For instance, there might be separate IT systems for spot, nonlinear and option trades - each one crossing many asset classes. 

Control and support must be provided for every product type in every asset class. This can be represented as a two-dimensional table with the various asset classes in one dimension and the range of trade types in the other:

Since many companies were left with unwanted credit risk on their books, a market was started to trade credit risk with other companies that were prepared to carry the risk in return for some financial incentive.

We begin our discussion of credit derivatives by examining all of the main products, and then show how credit products differ from other asset classes. 

## CDS

A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract between two parties referencing an entity or asset: a **buyer of protection**, also known as the **seller of risk**; and a **seller of protection**, also called the **buyer of risk**. 

A simple example would be: JPMorgan buys protection from Banco Santander referencing Ford Motor Credit (Ford Motor Credit is the reference entity). The contract would have 

* a **specific term**, say five years; 
* an agreed **notional amount**, say USD 10m; 
* a pre agreed **premium**, typically called the **CDS spread** say 800bp = 800 basis points = 8 % per annum - so the annual premium is approximately 10m × 800/10 000 = USD 800 000 per annum; 
* an agreed list of **credit events**; 
* and other details including payment method on a credit event.

A credit event triggers the termination of the contract and a capital payment. Typical credit events include bankruptcy, failure to pay, or restructuring of outstanding debt. In the context of credit derivatives, the term “default” is often used to mean “credit event”. In contrast, “default” for bond assets typically only means failure to pay.

When a credit event occurs, the seller of protection pays either:

* physical settlement: USD 10m in return for USD 10m notional of Ford Motor Credit debt; (seller of protection takes over the debt) or
* cash settlement: a net sum representing USD 10m less the value of Ford Motor Credit debt in the marketplace.

In the above example, Ford Motor Credit debt in the marketplace may be trading at 20 % of notional value (USD 2m in this case). The figure of 20 % is referred to as the **recovery value** and the balance is the **loss given default**.

		<td>Insurance regulator</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Insured is loss of value on the debt of a reference entity</td>
		<td>Insured is a physical asset</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Now, many CDS contracts are quoted with a fixed ongoing premium of 500 basis points (sometimes 100 basis points) and a variable initial (known as “upfront”) premium. There has been a move away from physically settled CDS contracts (where default results in the protection buyer delivering the defaulted asset to the seller and receiving the amount under protection) to cash settlement (without any asset delivery upon default). Also, there now exists an auction on many CDS contracts that facilitates more open participation and the standardisation of prices.

In addition to “single name” CDS contracts, it is possible to purchase a CDS on an index which is a contract offering protection on a basket of entities. 

## CLN

A **credit linked note** (CLN) repackages a single name credit default swap in the form of a bond.

The CLN would be for the same principal amount and maturity as the CDS. The final terms of the CLN would mirror the terms in the CDS transaction:

	|<----------  CLN ----------->|   |<--------- CLS ------------->|
    
	+----------+    Coupon     +----------+   Fixed Payment  +----------+
	|          |<--------------|          |<-----------------|          |
	| Investor |               | Banco S. |                  | JPMorgan |
	|          |-------------->|          |                  |          |
	+----------+    Principal  +----------+                  +----------+

Provided there is no credit event by the reference entity the investor receives back the principal investment on the maturity of the note:

	+----------+               +----------+                  +----------+
	|          |               |          |                  |          |
	| Investor |               | Banco S. |                  | JPMorgan |
	|          |<--------------|          |                  |          |
	+----------+    Principal  +----------+                  +----------+

What happens if the reference entity experiences a credit event?:

* The CDS on which the bank sold protection is triggered. The bank pays to the CDS counterparty the principal amount of the CDS in cash. The bank receives in return a deliverable instrument normally a bond that was issued by the reference entity that is now in default.
* The CLN is also triggered. The investor does not get his principal returned, instead the bank on-delivers the bond to the CLN buyer

	+----------+               +----------+  Principal(cash) +----------+
	|          |               |          |----------------->|          |
	| Investor |               | Banco S. |                  | JPMorgan |  Ford Motor Bond
	|          |<--------------|          |<-----------------|          |<------------------
	+----------+      Bond     +----------+      Bond        +----------+

The investor will have experienced a loss as a result of the credit event because the delivered bond will be worth less than the original sum invested. The scale of the loss incurred will depend on the market value of the delivered bond.

If the credit default swap is packaged into a credit linked note, then the product is referred to as **funded**. Othereise it is **unfunded**.

### Why investors buy CLNs

The investor has the credit risk on the reference entity as well as the CLN issuer and therefore obtains a higher return on the CLN than would have been achieved on a normal medium term note.

This means that different CLNs can be issued that exactly fit the investor's criteria including return, rating, maturity and amount. 

It can also mean that investors who are restricted from using credit derivatives because of operational, legal or regulatory constraints can still create the investments they want.

Furthermore some investors are "real" investors - they have cash and need to use it. CLNs are cash based investments and meet these investor's requirements.

CLNs are also relatively simple to book from the buyer's perspective they are often regarded as cash instruments rather than derivatives. This means the investor does not need to enter into an ISDA master agreement. The final terms that accompany the CLN will contain the detailed information concerning the workings of the transaction.

### Why issuers sell CLNs

The issuer receives cash from the sale of the CLN. This has two advantages.

First it can mean that the cost of funding for the issuer can be at or below the target cost of funding.

Second because the issuer has cash it means that the embedded CDS is effectively 100% cash collateralised, (remember that the issuer is selling protection to the market place but buying protection from the investor). If there is a credit event the issuer is in control of the cash and is not dependent on the performance of the investor, (as it would normally be the case with a CDS).

### Investopedia definition

A security with an embedded credit default swap allowing the issuer to transfer a specific credit risk to credit investors.

CLNs are created through a Special Purpose Company (SPC), or trust, which is collateralized with AAA-rated securities. Investors buy securities from a trust that pays a fixed or floating coupon during the life of the note. At maturity, the investors receive par unless the referenced credit defaults or declares bankruptcy, in which case they receive an amount equal to the recovery rate. The trust enters into a default swap with a deal arranger. In case of default, the trust pays the dealer par minus the recovery rate in exchange for an annual fee which is passed on to the investors in the form of a higher yield on the notes. 

## CDO

A CDO structure is a credit derivative which references not just a single name, but a portfolio of risks (see Figure 5.1). There is one further key difference: **tranching of risk**. This relates primarily to the capital flows when credit events occur in the reference pool.

A CDO is linked to a **reference pool**. This is a portfolio of reference risks - often bonds or default swap contracts (the “asset side”). This portfolio may exist only as a list of reference instruments. It need not exist as an actual portfolio of assets. The purpose of the reference pool is to define cashflows on the CDO tranches. The reference pool typically includes 30 to 200 (but sometimes thousands) of risks. For example, Ford Motor Credit (USD 5m), Unilever (USD 7m), Toyota (USD 10m) . . . Let us say, the total of the individual notional amounts is USD 100m.

The “liability side” of a CDO is made up of tranches of risk which are, in effect, passed on to the buyer of risk. For example, these might be the first 5 % of risk (USD 5m) - often called the “First Loss Piece (FLP)”; then the next 10 % (USD 10m); then the remaining 85 % (USD 85m). If reference assets default, the loss (notional exposure less recovery on the reference entity debt) hits the first 5 % tranche, but the other tranches are unaffected. As losses mount up, the 5 % tranche may get eliminated and then losses start to eat into the 10 % tranche. However, the 85 % tranche is unaffected until losses exceed 15 % of the original exposure.

For example, suppose Ford Motor Credit defaults with a 20 % recovery - a loss of USD 4m. The first tranche is reduced to USD 1m. The buyer of risk on the FLP pays USD 4m on the occurrence of the Ford credit event.

If Unilever then defaults with zero recovery (USD 7m loss), then the buyer of risk on the FLP pays USD 1m and that tranche terminates. The buyer of risk on the 10 % tranche pays the balance (USD 6m). The tranche continues with USD 4m notional. If Toyota defaults with a 50 % recovery (USD 5m loss) then the buyer of risk on the 10 % tranche pays USD 4m and that tranche terminates. The buyer of risk on the 85 % tranche now pays USD 1m and the tranche continues with USD 84m notional.

The premiums paid to the risk takers on the various tranches differ. The FLP is the highest risk tranche and carries the highest premium - possibly thousands of basis points. The most senior tranche is the lowest risk and may carry a very low premium - just a few basis points in some cases.

Credit triggers are typically the same as for single name credit default swaps. CDO tranches are often issued in funded (credit linked note) form. This means the notional of the note declines as credit events are called. The notional will reduce to zero if that tranche of risk is eaten up by credit event losses.

The reference pool may or may not exist as a portfolio of assets. In cases where all tranches of risk are sold, a simple “hedge” would actually be to buy all of the risky assets. It is also common to sell individual tranches of CDOs done. The hedge assets would then be different from the reference pool.

CDOs are an example of “structured credit”. It is the structuring of risk, rather than having an untranched portfolio, which brings a new element to the product and which makes pricing difficult. The term “CDO contract” typically relates to a specific tranche, rather than all tranches, and may be in unfunded (CDS) form or in funded (CLN) form.
